# MFC-Chat-Room

Visual C++

On the basis of understanding the Internet protocol and Socket, design a simple application layer protocol, and design and program the network chat software. If you use an unequal Client/Server structure, you need to write a client program and a server program separately. Its basic functions are:

1. The server creates a socket and enters the listening state.

2. The client enters the user name to log in and establish a connection.

3. Server and client can send chat messages to each other.

4. The server can be set to "Leave" status and "Online" status. In the "Leave" status, the client will automatically reply when sending a message to the server.

5. The server can send pictures, documents, audio, video and other files to the client. The client can receive the file and save it, and both the sending and receiving status can get feedback.

6. The above functions are implemented in the MFC interface.
